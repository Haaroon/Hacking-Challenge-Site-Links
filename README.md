Updated Hacking Challenge Site Links
January 15, 2018 blackroomsec	

These are 70+ sites which offer free challenges for hackers to practice their skills. Some are web-based challenges, some require VPN access to private labs and some are downloadable ISOs and VMs. I’ve tested the links at the time of this posting and they work.

Most of them are at https://www.wechall.net but if I missed a few they will be there.

WeChall is a portal to hacking challenges where you can link your account to all the sites and get ranked. I’ve been a member since 2/2/14.

Internally to the site they have challenges there as well so make sure you check them out!

 

To find CTFs go to https://www.ctftime.org

On Twitter in the search field type CTF

Google is also your friend.

Update 1/15/18 –

Hacker Nellebot suggested this and while it’s not a hacking site, I agree that puzzles like this are important to strengthen your skills. In my upcoming hacking notes release, I talk about this very topic!

I also added the links mentioned in the responses in my Twitter thread. Thank you! If you know of more, DM me!

Second update 1/15/18 – Hacker Evan Booth of Counter Hack suggested I add Holiday Hack. My apologies to Evan and our friends over at SANS/Counter Hack for not including it the first go around. I have IMMENSE respect for what you all do and love you guys and what you give to us! I just thought since it’s a yearly challenge it wouldn’t fit but my bad! They can technically be done all year round. Here it is!
